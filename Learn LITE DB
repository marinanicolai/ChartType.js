- Learn about basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in LiteDB.
- Understand how to work with collections and documents.

#### Tasks:
1. **Database Creation**: Learn how to create and connect to a LiteDB database.
2. **Data Insertion**: Practice inserting documents into your database.
3. **Data Retrieval**: Learn how to query and retrieve data.
4. **Updating and Deleting Data**: Practice updating and deleting documents.

### Week 3: Advanced Querying and Indexing

#### Objectives:
- Master complex queries in LiteDB.
- Understand indexing for performance optimization.

#### Tasks:
1. **Advanced Queries**: Dive into more complex queries, including filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.
2. **Indexing**: Learn about indexing in LiteDB and how to create indexes on collections for faster queries.

### Week 4: Real-world Application and Best Practices

#### Objectives:
- Apply your knowledge to a real-world scenario.
- Learn best practices for using LiteDB in production.

#### Tasks:
1. **Project Development**: Develop a small project or feature in an existing project using LiteDB. It could be a simple task management tool, a local data cache for a web application, etc.
2. **Best Practices**: Research best practices for using LiteDB, such as data modeling, transaction management, and concurrency.

### Week 5: Advanced Features and Exploration

#### Objectives:
- Explore advanced features of LiteDB.
- Learn about LiteDB's limitations and alternatives.

#### Tasks:
1. **Advanced Features**: Explore features like file storage (storing files/images in the database), data encryption, and event listeners.
2. **Limitations**: Understand the limitations and scenarios where LiteDB might not be the best choice.

### Week 6: Review and Real-world Testing

#### Objectives:
- Review what you've learned.
- Test your project in a real-world scenario.

#### Tasks:
1. **Code Review**: Review the code of your project. Refine and optimize it.
2. **Real-world Testing**: Test your application in a more realistic environment. Gather feedback and make adjustments.

### Continual Learning:
- **Stay Updated**: Follow LiteDB's updates and community for new features and improvements.
- **Contribute**: If possible, contribute to the LiteDB community through forums, blogs, or even code contributions.

### Resources:
